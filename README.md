# House Price Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on features such as size, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended).
3. Install project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the code using Python.

## Code Structure

- `house_price.py`: Contains the main code for house price prediction.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies for easy installation.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Prices dataset from scikit-learn.

## Model

We use a Ridge regression model with polynomial features and feature scaling for house price prediction.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics. Learning curves are also provided to assess model performance with different training set sizes.
